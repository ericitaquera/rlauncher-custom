## rlauncher-custom
Rocket Launcher is a great project which abstract several emulators, rom extensions, side scripts, help applications and whatever allowing game emulators like Hyperspin to run a game smoothly. However, unfortunatelly, there is no official update since [version 1.2.0.1](https://www.rlauncher.com/forum/index.php?threads/rocketlauncher-v1-2-0-1.4301/)

I´m adding some updates to (currently stale) [Rocket Launcher](https://www.rlauncher.com/) by djvj and team.

I´ll publish here whenever I add or alter code to leverage stuff useful for my setup.

Those changes were tested in my Setup only and I can´t assure it´ll not destroy your system.

Use at your own risk.


## Usage:
Simply copy and replace the files from here to the same directory structure of your RocketLauncher setup.

## Usage Example:
To use my custom Virtual Drive.ahk

First of all: BACKUP YOUR STUFF BEFORE PROCEEDING.

Second of all: From anywhere in your filesystem run.

git clone https://github.com/ericitaquera/rlauncher-custom.git (this will download this repository under a subdirectory called "rlauncher-custom"

Copy the file from this new directory to your Rocket Laucher setup in the very same relative path.

E.g:

From:
